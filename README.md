# Recipe Finder Application

The Recipe Finder Application serves as a versatile platform enabling users to search for recipes based on specific keywords. The primary goal of this assignment is to deliver a responsive, user-friendly interface that facilitates searching, viewing, and saving recipes. This application is implemented as a web application using React.js.

## Features

1. **Recipe Search**: On the homepage, provide a search bar allowing users to seek recipes by entering keywords, such as ingredients or dish names. Employ a recipe API to fetch and exhibit a list of recipes based on the user's input. Ensure that the application dynamically retrieves recipes as users type, ensuring a seamless search experience. You can use APIs like Edamam or Spoonacular for this purpose.

2. **Recipe Details Page**: Enable users to access comprehensive information about a selected recipe, including its title, ingredients, cooking instructions, and an image. Display the recipe details on a distinct screen or page, ensuring a clear and user-friendly layout.

3. **Favorite Recipes**: Allow users to save their preferred recipes for future reference from the recipe details page. Provide users with an option to save recipes, storing this data in local storage.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement effective handling of failed API requests or instances where no results are found. Present user-friendly error messages and ensure that the application gracefully manages unexpected situations.

5. **Styling and User Interface (UI/UX)**: Apply an attractive and user-friendly design to the application. Create a responsive and visually appealing UI/UX suitable for both web and mobile versions.
